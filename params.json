{"name":"Phj","tagline":"PHJ is a PHP library","body":"### Welcome to PHJ\r\nPHJ, or Preprocessed Harvested Jobs, is a php custom library.\r\nIt can be considered to be a Content Management System (CMS), however it is a bit different that just that. It requires a proper setup, just like a framework.\r\nBefore starting to use PHJ you need to tell php that you are actually using PHJ, by including the library inside the first file that HTTP usualy encounters in our Root directory, usually called \"index.php\".\r\n\r\n### How to start\r\n1. [Download the PHJ library](http://www.mediafire.com/edit/acfjrh6b9y4byab/phj.php)\r\n2. `Then...`\r\n   * Open up index.php (or whatever your file is called)\r\n   * Call the ob_start() function\r\n   * Enstablish a connection with a database (if you want to)\r\n   * Include the PHJ library in your project.\r\n     ![](http://phj.besaba.com/img/guida/1.jpg)\r\n     The ob_start function () will organize your buffer.\r\n3. Create a new .phj or .html file.\r\nI suggest you to use a .html file to begin with.\r\nUsually editors would help yout writting your HTML code if it recognizes the .html; The reason you should pick .html instead of .phj is purely graphic and editor related since they won't recognize the .phj extension.\r\n4. Create a new object.\r\nWhile using PHJ your are turning your web application into an object. The commands themselves are considered arguments of the object ( of your web application ), and in some cases the commands are also objects themselves, so you would have objects inside other objects.\r\n![](http://phj.besaba.com/img/guida/2.jpg)\r\n$site= new PHJ ( \"website title\", \"used language\", \"/Root directory\", \"main file that you will be using.PHJ ( or .HTML)\" );\r\n5. Return the interpreted PHJ content using the fill() function.\r\n![](http://phj.besaba.com/img/guida/3.jpg)\r\n\r\nNow all your work will be mainly focused on the index.html file (or whatever you called it), not in the index.php.\r\nYou will probably never touch again index.php.\r\nFor more information visit [http://phj.besaba.com/introduction](http://phj.besaba.com/introduction)","google":"framework phj library","note":"Don't delete this file!
